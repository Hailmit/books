<p class="CO">What an extraordinary half hour. How can I explain it? To be <i>useful</i> again, not as a tea-and-cheese-bringer, or a potato-cooker and applesauce-maker, but, almost, as a librarian.</p>
<p class="TX">To be engaged with a young mind—a curious mind! It was wonderful. I felt I had to stop myself from floating up off the floor right in front of him (although I had never actually managed to float). For once, I was <i>grateful</i> for my unsatisfactory invisibility. That struggle, which I had always thought of as a weakness, had given me this beautiful moment.</p>
<p class="TX">I looked out the window and across the way, to where <span aria-label=" Page 147. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_147" role="doc-pagebreak"/>my little library stood. I felt proud of our town for making it grow, and proud of the dear cat for watching over it. And I remembered Ms. Scoggin’s words. <i>You are a librarian, are you not?</i></p>
