<p class="CO">Mortimer had slept for only a few hours, which was not enough sleep for a cat. He blinked at the boy, who was now opening the small library doors.</p>
<p class="TX">His library’s first visitor! He summoned his strength and sat up.</p>
<p class="TX">The boy was Evan, he remembered. Like his hearing, Mortimer’s memory was excellent. From his many hours of sitting at his upstairs window in the History House, Mortimer had learned a lot about the people of Martinville, including most of their names.</p>
<p class="TX">He watched the boy read Al’s sign. <span class="CAPS">T</span><small>AKE A BOOK, LEAVE A BOOK.</small> <span class="CAPS">O</span><small>R BOTH.</small></p>
<p class="TX"><i>A face</i>, Mortimer thought, <i>can also be a question mark</i>.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 21. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_21" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Unexpectedly, he felt his small heart pounding. He wanted this boy with a question-mark face to take a book.</p>
<p class="TX">Evan’s hand darted into the library.</p>
<p class="TX"><i>Good</i>, Mortimer’s heart said. <i>Good</i>.</p>
<p class="TX">As he watched Evan walk away, Mortimer felt his exhaustion return. But the sight of Al, who was now coming across the lawn with his food dish, gave him strength.</p>
